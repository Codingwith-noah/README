Hi! Thank you for opening my repository. My name is Noah, I am 14 and have many things that I enjoy. Mainly, coding; Coding has been a hobby of mine for quite some time now.
I started coding whenever I was in the 5th grade, I am in the 9th now. Although it has been an on and off journey, I have stuck to it through all the years. However, I do have a
life outside of coding. I love to fish, fishing has been a hobby of mine since I was 2! I also enjoy yardwork, yep, that's right, yardwork. And yes, since you were wondering, I 
am a little bit crazy! Thank you for taking the time to read my masterpiece. Bye!
